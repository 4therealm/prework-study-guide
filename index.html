          <li>DRY coding: separating with a comma one can combine many selectors for a rule to apply to without having to write repetitive code</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class
               attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, 
               enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
